Need to update html with images and other stuff but layout is implemented in htlm and css.


original readme

Here is a grid system idea in CSS to build layouts such as image galleries!
An important part of this setup is thr auto-flow property which makes CSS automatically fill up all the cells of the grid no matter in which order you define them
You can setup this with different row and colum counts and even make them responsive based on the screen size.
If you want to have square images, setup the width and height of each image element youll add inside the grid cells to 100% and set object-fil cover
